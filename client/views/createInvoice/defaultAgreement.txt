In signing this contract, you enter into a transactional agreement with Metro Railings, a company that specializes in
 the manufacture and installation of all types of railings. Metro Railings will build and install fitted hand
 railings at the address given below (henceforth known as the Installation Address). These railings will be built
 according to all design specifications noted above. The order will be considered fulfilled when the railings are
 successfully installed at the Installation Address.

In exchange for us providing you our services, you will pay us the amount specified above as the "Order Total"
(henceforth, we will refer to this amount as the "Order Total").

You will be paying one-half of the Order Total upon signing this agreement. We will begin work after the payment for
that first half of the Order Total is fully processed. After we finish installing the railings at the Installation
Address, you will pay off the remaining balance on the Order Total. That second payment will serve as your
acknowledgement that the order has been completely fulfilled. Should you fail to make that second payment or should
any of your payments fail to process successfully, Metro Railings has the right to take back its railings.

Should you pay us the first half by credit card, then unless otherwise directed, you give Metro Railings permission
to charge the rest of the balance on that credit card automatically once the order is fulfilled.

If Metro Railings fails to fulfill the order in 30 days, you will be entitled to a refund of a quarter of
the money you paid us. We will also commit more resources to fulfilling your order.

Metro Railings extends a lifetime warranty on any aluminum product it manufactures. Furthermore, Metro Railings also
provides a ten-year limited warranty on the powder coating applied to any of these products.

This agreement supersedes any prior and verbal agreements made between you and any representative of Metro Railings.
