In signing this contract, you enter into a transactional agreement with Metro Railings. Metro Railings will build and
 install fitted hand railings at the address given above (henceforth known as the Installation Address). These
 railings will be built according to all design specifications noted above. The order will be considered fulfilled
 when the railings are successfully installed at the Installation Address.

In exchange for us providing you our services, you will pay us the amount specified above as the "Order Total"
(henceforth, we will refer to this amount as the "Order Total").

If you are paying by credit card, you will be paying the Order Total in full upon signing this agreement. Upon paying
 us, you will have a 24-hour grace period to cancel the order and request a full refund. After we install the
 railings, you will be required to sign a form indicating that the order has been entirely fulfilled.

If you are paying by check, you will be paying one-half of the Order Total upon signing this agreement. After we
finish installing the railings at the Installation Address, you will pay us the remaining half of the Order Total.
That second payment will serve as your acknowledgement that the order has been completely fulfilled. Should you fail
to make that second payment or should any of your checks bounce, Metro Railings has the right to take back its railings.

If Metro Railings fails to fulfill the order within fifteen days, you will be entitled to a refund of a quarter of
the money you paid us. We will also commit more resources to fulfilling your order.

This agreement supersedes any prior and verbal agreements made between you and any representative of Metro Railings.
