	<p>
		In signing this contract, you enter into a transactional agreement with Metro Railings. Metro Railings will build and
		install fitted hand railings at the address given above (henceforth known as the Installation Address). These
		railings will be built according to all design specifications noted above. The order will be considered fulfilled
		when the railings are successfully installed at the Installation Address.

		In exchange for us providing you our services, you will pay us the amount specified above as the "Order Total"
		(henceforth, we will refer to this amount as the "Order Total").

		Regardless of whether you pay by check or cash, you will be paying <span class='bolded spaceBeforeAndAfter'>at
		least</span> one-half of the Order Total upon signing this agreement. After we finish installing the
		railings at the Installation Address, you will pay us the remaining amount of the Order Total.
		That second payment will serve as your acknowledgement that the order has been completely fulfilled. Should you fail
		to make that second payment or should any of your checks bounce, Metro Railings has the right to take back its railings.

		If Metro Railings fails to fulfill the order within fifteen days after your first payment has been processed,
		you will be entitled to a refund of a quarter of the money you paid us. We will also commit more resources to
		fulfilling your order.

		This agreement supersedes any prior and verbal agreements made between you and any representative of Metro Railings.
