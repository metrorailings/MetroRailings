These railings will be designed in such a manner so as to not take attention away from the other railings and decorations on the front porch. Therefore, these railings will be basic handrailings that do not feature any pickets. These handrailings will be constructed with our smallest posts and handrailings in order to remain as inconspicuous as possible. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the top handrails do not sport any sharply defined edges, we will be finishing off the ends of these top rails with the volute end. Lastly, these railings will be finished off with our Midnight Black powder coating.<br /><br />The other set of railings will be for the main steps on the front porch. These railings will be designed to mimic the other railings on the front porch as much as possible. The design specifications listed above apply to these railings. Also, four feet of additional railing will be needed to contain exposed openings on both sides of the top step. If these openings are not railed in, the house would fail to pass inspection.","internal":""},"pricing":{"pricePerFoot":45,"additionalPrice":0,"deductions":130,"orderTotal":1850,"balanceRemaining":0,"modification":-462.5,"restByCheck":false},"customer":{"name":"Ed Herrmann","email":"ejh41@verizon.net","areaCode":"908","phoneOne":"697","phoneTwo":"0085","address":"83 Long View Terrace","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"Gillette","state":"NJ","zipCode":"07933","nickname":"Ed","aptSuiteNumber":""},"design":{"post":"P-BPC","postEnd":"","postCap":"PC-SQ","center":"CD-NONE","color":"white","handrailing":"H-COL","picket":"PCKT-3/4"},"status":"closed","createDate":"2017-07-14T02:24:27.875Z","lastModifiedDate":"2017-08-30T16:10:57.610Z","modHistory":[{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-07-14T02:24:27.875Z"},{"user":"system","date":"2017-07-14T14:44:04.834Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-08-14T05:52:45.636Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-08-14T06:01:50.206Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-08-15T00:29:51.835Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-08-30T16:10:31.107Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2017-08-30T16:10:57.610Z"}],"ccToken":"tok_1AfV1UIZYp4JZqQHYjPgyPZ1","stripe":{"customer":"cus_B1Y71vNMyLFsxT","charges":["ch_1AfV1WIZYp4JZqQHsgx8sSRz","ch_1AwYmMIZYp4JZqQHiCghXoVH"]},"isPaid":false,"installation":{"coverPlates":true,"platformType":"cement"},"rushOrder":null,"finishedHeight":36},{"_id":1573,"length":17,"additionalFeatures":"","agreement":["In signing this contract, you enter into a transactional agreement with Metro Railings.

Given that the upper set of steps are wider than the first set of steps, we will need to shift the railings 4\" outwards as it traverses the middle platform that joins together the two staircases.<br /><br />On the other side of the path, we will install two railings, because Ross has indicated that he wants an opening on the middle platform so that the yard is accessible. One railing will be for the bottom staircase while the other railing will be for the top set of steps and the upper platform.<br /><br />While S/C scrolls have been specified here as the center design for these railings, Ross has notified us that he wants that design to appear only once along the railings.

Both railings will connect to two rectangular pillars that will be placed opposite one another near the edge of the top step. These pillars are needed to support a canopy roof above the front entrance to the house.<br /><br />The rear balcony will need two railings totaling roughly 11 feet in length. We understand that the flooring of the balcony consists of plywood and fiberglass. Due to the sensitive nature of those materials, we will be using screws instead of cement to install and stabilize the railings. Rustproof screws will be used to lock in these railings. Both railings will also connect to a single rectangular pillar that will be placed on the exposed corner facing out directly to the backyard.<br /><br />Lastly, the back patio requires 46 feet of railing. Railing is needed here primarily to keep people (especially children) from falling off exposed ledges.<br /><br />Instead of pickets, we will be incorporating 1/4\" diameter stainless steel cabling into the railings instead. Galvanized cables specially designed to be maintenance-free will be used here.<br /><br />All railings will be designed in the modern style. None of the railings will sport any round features aside from the cabling.\" <br /><br />Please note that off the recommendation of our lead representative Wilson, the installation will be done in two phases. The first phase will simply be installing the pillars first. After we install the pillars, we will remeasure both the front porch and the balcony to determine the final amount of railing truly needed for those areas. We do not expect whatever new numbers we get to deviate much (if at all) from the current measurements we have on file. But we will proceed with the installations in this manner to ensure that the railings for these two areas perfectly fit their surroundings.<br />","internal":"Waiting on end caps to cover cut cabling from Architectural Iron.

The other 48 feet of railing will serve as brand-new railing that will be installed along the inside of the parapet walls that line the edges of the roof.<br /><br />Note that this job carries a few risk elements. Our installation technicians will be working off the edges of the roof in order to screw these replacement railings directly into the brick facades of the building. Furthermore, these replacement railings will need to be handled very carefully and slowly in order to completely mitigate any chance of a railing falling off the edge. In discussion with the two representatives that have visited the site, I have been advised to apply a relatively small risk premium to the job. Therefore, an additional $800 will be levied here to properly account for the extra time and manpower that will be dedicated to this job during the installation phase.","internal":[{"note":"We should be done here.

The railings will be built according to traditional industrial design principles.<br /><br />The frame of the railings will consist of 1.5\" diameter pipe handrailings and square posts. Two sets of square posts will be employed in order to fabricate all railings - 1.5\" and 2.5\" square posts. Both sets of posts will be used in alternating fashion, so every odd post will be 1.5\" square while every even post will be a 2.5\" square. 1.5\" by 1\" rectangular bottom channels will be used here to join the posts together from th ebottom and keep the pickets stabilized.  The body of the railings will consist of 3/4\" square pickets that are no more than 3\" apart from one another.<br /><br />Once the railings are fully fabricated, we plan on polishing them smooth and then baking them in our in-house oven so as to remove any excess grease and other impurities. After this initial heat treatment, we will completely coat all railings with a traditional bronze finishing powder and heat treat them once more, ensuring a colored finish that lasts for many years to come. <br /><br />Installation will be handled completely by Metro Railings. Any fittings used to join together sections of railings that meet together in any capacity will be practically concealed from view.  Drainage holes will be drilled into the bottom of each post to ensure that any water that may find its way inside the post can flow out. Each railing post will be anchored into the ground into 4\"-deep cored holes that will then be filled with specialized quickset cement that will lock the railing into place. The areas where cement will be poured will be masked with cover plates that will themselves be coated with the same finish as the railings. All such railings will be installed level and flush to the ground.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that 247 inches of railing will need to be curved so as to accommodate a curved section of walkway that leads right into the upper part of the ramp.","internal":[{"note":"Phase 1 was finished under Vic.

The handrailing will be installed 36 inches high on both of the walls that guard the passageway. The handrailing will sit inside custom-fitted brackets that will be anchored into the wall with tapcon screws. It is worth noting that in one section of the passageway, guardrails are currently there to protect two windows along that section. When we run handrailing out across those windows, we will have to project the railing outward into the walking space further than what's specified on the architect's drawings. We do this so as to ensure that the handrailing comes together gracefully as one continuous piece that somebody can hold comfortably while walking through the passageway.<br /><br />The open space requires 38 feet of standing railing. The railing will be designed according to what is shown in the architect's blueprint. The railing will consist of pipe posts joined together by two lines of pipe tubing running parallel to one another, one line being placed on top of the railing (so that people can grasp the railing) and the other line 12 inches below the top line.","internal":[{"note":"Spoke to Brian.

signing this contract, you enter into a transactional agreement with Metro Railings, a company that specializes in\n the manufacture and installation of all types of railings and gates. From here until the end of these agreement, these\n railings and gates will be referred to as \"Company Product\". Metro Railings will build and install fitted Company\n Product at the address given below (henceforth known as the \"Installation Address\"). This Company Product will be built\n according to all design specifications noted above. The order will be considered fulfilled when the Company Product is\n successfully installed at the Installation Address.","In exchange for us providing you with Company Product and any other services stipulated elsewhere in the table above,\nyou will pay us the amount specified above as the \"Order Total\" (henceforth, we will refer to this amount as the \"Order Total\").","You will be paying one-half of the Order Total upon signing this agreement. We will begin work after the payment for\nthat first half of the Order Total is fully processed. After we finish installing the railings at the Installation\nAddress, you will pay off the remaining balance on the Order Total. That second payment will serve as your\nacknowledgement that the order has been completely fulfilled. Should you fail to make that second payment or should\nany of your payments fail to process successfully, Metro Railings has the right to take back its railings.","Should you pay us the first half by credit card, then unless otherwise directed, you give Metro Railings permission\nto charge the rest of the balance on that credit card automatically once the order is fulfilled.","During installation, please keep in mind that we may be drilling holes in order to anchor the railings into whatever\nplatform or ground they will be standing upon. Should any of the holes we need to drill require us to drill through\nrebar or granite, we will need to charge you $60 for each hole that requires us to drill through rebar or granite.\nThe reason we must impose this charge is not only does it take a significantly longer time to drill through rebar or\ngranite, but doing so takes a toll on our beloved drilling equipment.","The Order Total indicated above covers the entire cost of this order. Installation, warranties, and taxes are all\nencapsulated in that Order Total. Should we find that our representatives have failed to provide accurate\nmeasurements of the area come installation time, the company is willing to provide up to ten extra feet of railing\n for free in order to ensure that the area is properly railed according to code and customer needs.","Metro Railings extends a lifetime warranty on any aluminum product it manufactures. Furthermore, Metro Railings also\nprovides a ten-year limited warranty on the powder coating applied to any of these products. All such warranties\npromised by Metro Railings covers only damage caused by the passage of time. These warranties do not cover\ndamages sustained by the railings as a result of external impact forces or acts of God.","This agreement supersedes any prior and verbal agreements made between you and any representative of Metro Railings."],"timeLimit":{"original":30},"notes":{"order":"Metro Railings proposes to fabricate eight sections of glass railings for the residential building located at the installation address indicated below. <br /> Two different types of glass railings will be used for this project - framed glass railings and wall-mounted glass railings. <br /><br />One section of framed glass railing will be installed outside the building on a set of steps. Framed glass railings involves setting glass panels inside aluminum frames that we build completely in-house. These frames are comprised of 1.5\" square posts, a U-channel on the bottom, and a modern rectangular handrail up top. Thin lines of rubber gaskets will be couched between the aluminum frame and glass panel so that the glass remains comfortably secure inside the frame.<br /><br />The outside of the building also needs one more section of railing to run along a false balcony. The glass railing here will be wall-mounted instead. Wall-mounted glass railings involve directly anchoring the glass on the platform, using clamps that are specially designed to stabilize the glass against the side of the platform. The clamps will be fitted through the panels of glass and screwed directly into the side of the platform parallel to the railing. A modern-style handrailing will then be fitted on the top edge of the glass for graspability purposes.<br /><br />Six sections of glass railings are needed inside the building. Four sections will be installed along four sets of risers inside the building.  Two sections will be installed along landing areas on the second and third floors. All six sections of railing here will be wall-mounted. <br /><br />All glass will be a half-inch thick, as well as tempered and laminated for additional durability. Any edges of glass panels that will be left exposed will be polished so as to as remove any extraneous shards or rough textures. All metal components will be finished with a urban silver color.","internal":""},"installation":{"platformType":"earth","coverPlates":true},"pricing":{"pricePerFoot":198,"additionalPrice":0,"deductions":0,"subTotal":18810,"tax":0,"orderTotal":18810,"balanceRemaining":18810},"customer":{"name":"Zahra Saeed","email":"zahra@zahrasaeed.com","areaCode":"267","phoneOne":"270","phoneTwo":"1551","address":"241 West Jefferson St","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zipCode":"19122","nickname":"Zahra"},"design":{"post":"P-SP","handrailing":"Modern","picket":"","postEnd":"Extension","postCap":"","center":"CD-NONE","color":"silver"},"status":"pending","createDate":"2018-04-25T19:11:54.990Z","lastModifiedDate":"2018-04-25T19:11:54.990Z","modHistory":[{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-04-25T19:11:54.990Z"}]},{"_id":1708,"notes":{"order":"The Cambridge Club needs to stabilize parts of a cable railing system that's install on its rooftop deck.<br /><br />36 posts will need to be reinforced.

Metro Railings will build and install fitted Company\n Product at the address given below (henceforth known as the \"Installation Address\"). This Company Product will be built\n according to all design specifications noted above. The order will be considered fulfilled when the Company Product is\n successfully installed at the Installation Address.","In exchange for us providing you with Company Product and any other services stipulated elsewhere in the table above,\nyou will pay us the amount specified above as the \"Order Total\" (henceforth, we will refer to this amount as the \"Order Total\").","You will be paying one-half of the Order Total upon signing this agreement. We will begin work after the payment for\nthat first half of the Order Total is fully processed. After we finish installing the railings at the Installation\nAddress, you will pay off the remaining balance on the Order Total. That second payment will serve as your\nacknowledgement that the order has been completely fulfilled. Should you fail to make that second payment or should\nany of your payments fail to process successfully, Metro Railings has the right to take back its railings.","Should you pay us the first half by credit card, then unless otherwise directed, you give Metro Railings permission\nto charge the rest of the balance on that credit card automatically once the order is fulfilled.","During installation, please keep in mind that we may be drilling holes in order to anchor the railings into whatever\nplatform or ground they will be standing upon. Should any of the holes we need to drill require us to drill through\nrebar or granite, we will need to charge you $60 for each hole that requires us to drill through rebar or granite.\nThe reason we must impose this charge is not only does it take a significantly longer time to drill through rebar or\ngranite, but doing so takes a toll on our beloved drilling equipment.","The Order Total indicated above covers the entire cost of this order. Installation, warranties, and taxes are all\nencapsulated in that Order Total. Should we find that our representatives have failed to provide accurate\nmeasurements of the area come installation time, the company is willing to provide up to ten extra feet of railing\n for free in order to ensure that the area is properly railed according to code and customer needs.","Metro Railings extends a lifetime warranty on any aluminum product it manufactures. Furthermore, Metro Railings also\nprovides a ten-year limited warranty on the powder coating applied to any of these products. All such warranties\npromised by Metro Railings covers only damage caused by the passage of time.

The upper channel will feature no decorative scrolls or effects. Instead, every odd baluster built into the body of the railing will extend upwards through this channel all the way to the top handrail (like with a traditional railing).<br /><br />292 feet of railing will be used to rail in 40 Juliet balconies. Given the widths of these faux balconies, each of the railings for the Juliet balconies will be coming in one of three lengths - 6 feet, 7 feet, or 10 feet. None of the railings will sport any curves, as we are trying to keep these railings consistent with the modern look of the building. Therefore, if the railing needs to turn inward towards the building, all turns will be at a right angle. The railings will need to be anchored to the building with Tapcon screws at four different points in order to ensure stability. Please keep in mind that all Juliet railings will need to be screwed into the exterior of the building. As a result, we will need a boom lift so that our men can successfully install the railings into place right outside the faux balconies. It's worth noting that one side of the building is inaccessible to any boom lifts, so we may need to work with a scaffolding specialist to set up scaffolds outside the Juliet balconies on that side of the building.<br /><br />The rooftop itself will need 180 feet of railing in order to segregate sections of the roof from one another. The 180 feet of railing will be divided into two groups of railings, as these two groups of railings will each be fencing in a paved section of rooftop.<br /><br />Lastly, 171 feet of railing is needed for two bulkheads on top of the roof to pass code. The railings will completely surround the ledges of the bulkhead.<br /><br />All fabrication and installation will be handled directly by Metro Railings. No third-party shall be used to help us install these railings outside of a professional scaffolder.","internal":[{"note":"Finished, baby","author":"kinsho","date":"2019-07-11T20:08:03.535Z"},{"note":"Final pieces ready for install","author":"wparedes","date":"2019-04-09T16:46:29.911Z"},{"note":"Latter fabrication has started today.

These glass railings will only need to rise up 36 inches from the treads in order to be compliant with code.<br /><br />The glass railing for the stairs will be mounted via wall mounts - essentially, the glass will be anchored directly into the side of the steps that will be railed. Rounded standoff screws will be used to hold the glass into place. All these screws will be capped in order to keep them hidden from view. The glass railing for the second-floor walkway will be installed via floor-mount U-channels - essentially, the glass will be secured into place via a metal shoe that is specially designed to hold glass panels.<br /><br />All the glass railings will be topped off with a polished rectangular handrail so that people can grasp onto something should they need to hold on to the railing. The handrail should be kept skinny for aesthetic purposes, so the handrail will only be 2\" in width and 1\" in height. And in the spirit of making the glass as durable as possible, we will use only 1/2\" inch thick glass for this job. Furthermore, the glass will be tempered and laminated so that it can remain even more resilient against impact forces. All glass will be supplied from BlueStar Glass. All edges of the glass will be polished so as to remove any potentially rough or abrasive marks.<br />","internal":[{"note":"After years, we have finally finished her job.

The newel posts and every alternating picket will feature baskets in a 1-2 patterned fashion. The basket on the newel posts will be bigger to complement the bigger size of the post relative to the pickets. Furthermore, every picket will be twisted in an alternating pattern to give the railing some more complexity and rhythm to its design. Even the posts will be twisted as well along certain spots.<br /><br />Each end of the top handrail will be finished with a specialized lamb's tongue finish, in which the tongue will be ridged even more than usual to better match the lamb's tongue finish on the existing toprails inside the house.<br /><br />The pickets will be nestled in between the toprail and a bottom channel that runs parallel to the toprail.

All railings will be built according to residential code.","internal":[{"note":"Everything was installed, some scratches were cleaned up yesterday, we're good to go.","author":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-31T15:39:21.366Z"},{"note":"In Production ","author":"wparedes","date":"2018-08-21T23:05:31.330Z"},{"note":"Good to go on this order now.","author":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-20T16:48:22.505Z"},{"note":"Customer is trying to screw him over on payment, which is why the order has been halted for now.","author":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-16T17:25:11.218Z"},{"note":"Order has been called off...for now.","author":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-16T17:03:26.681Z"},{"note":"Measurements and template are ready if John decides to proceed with the order ","author":"wparedes","date":"2018-08-16T16:19:44.847Z"}]},"installation":{"platformType":"wood","coverPlates":true},"pricing":{"pricePerFoot":100,"additionalPrice":140,"deductions":0,"isTaxApplied":true,"isTariffApplied":false,"subTotal":9540,"tax":632.02,"tariff":0,"orderTotal":10172.02,"balanceRemaining":5086.01,"modification":0,"taxRemaining":0,"restByCheck":false},"customer":{"name":"Deck Guardian","email":"manager@deckguardian.com","areaCode":"732","phoneOne":"853","phoneTwo":"2115","address":"3 Barberi Court","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"Princeton","state":"NJ","zipCode":"","nickname":"Deck","aptSuiteNumber":""},"design":{"post":"P-BPC","handrailing":"H-STD","picket":"PCKT-3/4","postEnd":"","postCap":"Pyramid","center":"CD-NONE","color":"Textured Black"},"status":"closed","createDate":"2018-08-14T16:41:48.482Z","lastModifiedDate":"2018-08-31T15:39:21.366Z","modHistory":[{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-14T16:41:48.482Z"},{"user":"wparedes","date":"2018-08-16T16:19:44.847Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-16T17:03:26.681Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-16T17:25:11.218Z"},{"user":"system","date":"2018-08-20T16:47:26.203Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-20T16:48:22.505Z"},{"user":"wparedes","date":"2018-08-21T23:05:31.330Z"},{"user":"wparedes","date":"2018-08-21T23:10:37.879Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2018-08-31T15:39:21.366Z"}],"stripe":{"customer":"cus_DSAtM6LOdKElx0","charges":["ch_1D1GXMIZYp4JZqQHQv8qTL8D","ch_1D5EiTIZYp4JZqQHsyDpBGo1"]},"rushOrder":null,"ccToken":"tok_1D1GXJIZYp4JZqQHvMu4HP7V","finalizationDate":"2018-08-20T16:47:26.203Z","pictures":[{"name":"1762-1534892710673-1762-Deck Guardian.png","path_lower":"/orders/1762-1534892710673-1762-deck guardian.png","path_display":"/orders/1762-1534892710673-1762-Deck Guardian.png","id":"id:Uhj4dMOjo3AAAAAAAAABNw","client_modified":"2018-08-21T23:05:11Z","server_modified":"2018-08-21T23:05:11Z","rev":"1cb5c816c6b","size":567071,"content_hash":"55c0ca0dd67c3a39ab9ae0c48b423e99545eec22d88a6fef01ab9dcf408a4724","shareLink":"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/to0vqu58dzu1uzz/1762-1534892710673-1762-deck%20guardian.png?dl=0"}]},{"_id":1763,"length":67,"finishedHeight":36,"additionalFeatures":"A top channel will be designed into the railing.

The railings will be built according to traditional industrial design principles.<br /><br />The frame of the railings will consist of 1.5\" pipe handrailings and square posts. Two sets of square posts will be employed in order to fabricate all railings - 1.5\" and 2.5\" square posts. Both sets of posts will be used in an alternating fashion, so every odd post will be 1.5\" square while every even post will be a 2.5\" square. The body of the railings will consist of 3/4\" square pickets that are no more than 4\" apart from one another.<br /><br />All railings will be designed in the vista fashion, in that all railings will sport an upper channel devoid of any decorative scrolls or effects. Instead, only the small posts will be allowed to pass through this channel space to join with the pipe handrailing on top. Furthermore, all stair and ramp railings will also come equipped with an intermediate pipe handrail that will protrude from the railing, 36\" off the ground. These intermediate handrails will be finished off with 12\" long loops at each end, in full compliance with ADA code.<br /><br />All railings will be heat-treated and powder coated so as to ensure a lasting finish.<br /> <br />Installation will be handled completely by Metro Railings. Any fittings used to join together sections of railings that meet together in any capacity will be somewhat concealed from view.  Drainage holes will be drilled into the bottom of each post to ensure that any water that may find its way inside the post can flow out. Each railing post will be anchored into the ground into 6\"-deep cored holes that will then be filled with specialized cement in order to lock the railing into place. The areas where cement will be poured will be masked with cover plates that will themselves be coated with the same finish as the railings. All such railings will be installed level and flush to the ground.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that 247 inches of railing will need to be curved so as to accommodate a curved section of walkway that leads right into the upper part of the ramp.","internal":[{"note":"And we are done.

The railings will be topped off with an oak handrail stained with a walnut finish. The metallic components of the railings will be powder coated with a dark bronze finish (RAL 7022).<br /><br />Instead of a conventional channel, the bottom of the railings will feature a welded angle bracket designed to be installed flush against the edges of the balcony platform. 4\" lag screws will then be threaded through these angle brackets in order to anchor the railings into place. All railings will be designed to be 42\" inches high from the concrete up.

Essentially, lines of glass panels will be housed completely within 2\" wide aluminum frames that will be powder coated with a dark bronze finish (RAL 7022). These aluminum frames will be topped off with a rectangular handrail that will be 2\" wide and 1\" high. These handrails will be powder coated with the exact same finish as the frames holding the glass into place.<br /><br />The shorter side of the balcony will be railed with 6-foot high opaque glass panels in order to mask nearby air condition units from view. All opaque panels will be anchored into a specialized channel that will be grounded right before a hole that has been carved away from the shorter side of the balcony. The channel will be anchored into the balcony with 6-inch screws. Then the channel will be lined with multiple panel grips that are specially designed to hold glass into place via pressure. The 6-foot high glass panels will be inserted into these panel grips and tightened into place until the glass itself is rendered virtually immovable.<br /><br />All glass for this order will be clear, tempered, laminated and 1/2\" thick. Both tempering and lamination are necessary here to ensure the glass retains form even when struck by intense forces. Furthermore, the sides of all the glass will be polished to ensure that the glass looks completely smooth as it is fitted into place. Rubber gaskets will be squeezed into place along the top of the channel to mask the panel grips from view.<br /><br />We will also ensure that the glass guards will be installed approximately 2 inches away from any building wall. No part of these guards will be allowed to penetrate the stucco or brick facade of the building.","internal":[{"note":"Order: Glass railings and opaque glazing guards for a 3rd floor rear balcony","author":"wparedes","date":"2019-03-18T19:13:23.845Z"}]},"installation":{"platformType":"wood","coverPlates":true},"pricing":{"pricePerFoot":149.5,"additionalPrice":8260,"deductions":0,"isTaxApplied":false,"isTariffApplied":false,"subTotal":11250,"tax":0,"tariff":0,"orderTotal":11250,"balanceRemaining":11250,"modification":0,"taxRemaining":0,"restByCheck":false},"customer":{"name":"Two Kings Real Estate","email":"nicholas@twokingsrealestate.com","areaCode":"718","phoneOne":"887","phoneTwo":"6984","address":"148 Attorney Street","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"New York","state":"NJ","zipCode":"","nickname":"Two"},"design":{"post":"Modern Sleek","handrailing":"Modern Sleek","picket":"","postEnd":"","postCap":"","center":"CD-NONE","color":"Dark Bronze (RAL 7022)"},"status":"pending","createDate":"2019-01-31T18:27:38.404Z","lastModifiedDate":"2019-03-18T19:13:23.845Z","modHistory":[{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-01-31T18:27:38.404Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-02-05T17:29:33.971Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-02-05T17:31:05.199Z"},{"user":"wparedes","date":"2019-03-18T19:13:23.845Z"}],"stripe":null,"rushOrder":null},{"_id":1882,"length":4,"finishedHeight":36,"additionalFeatures":"A top channel will be designed into the railing.

The railings will be specifically made to match the size of the steps.  You can select a traditional railing look with a smaller 1.5\" post or also go with a more modern look with a 2.5\" post (included for the same price).  Also, there are a set of basic design options included in the price if you want to add a touch of decoration to the railings.  The railings will be powder coated in any color you decide.  The aluminum in combination with the powder coating finish will be the best in regards to low-maintenance.  The railings will never corrode or rust and also you do not have to worry about ever re-painting the railings as powder coating is one of the toughest and long lasting coating available in the industry.<br /><br /><br />Installation will be done by core drilling each post into the steps.  You will have a total of six posts core drilled and filled in with non-shrink anchoring cement which will not break or crack your steps.  Every post has a cover plate that covers any cement marks and also allows for a properly finished look.<br /><br />Once you decide to begin the job, we can have the railings ready for installation in 1-2 weeks.  <br /><br />If you have any questions or need additional information please feel to give me a call at 732-993-8220.<br /><br /><br />-Wilson ","internal":[]},"customer":{"name":"Beatrice Tokayer","email":"beatrice.rg@gmail.com","areaCode":"917","phoneOne":"484","phoneTwo":"0789","address":"839 Irvington Ave","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"HIllside","state":"NJ","zipCode":"","nickname":"Beatrice"},"status":"pending","lastModifiedDate":"2019-03-07T17:59:09.799Z","modHistory":[{"user":"wparedes","date":"2019-03-07T17:59:09.799Z"},{"user":"wparedes","date":"2019-03-07T17:50:17.178Z"}],"conception":{"userType":"admin","user":"wparedes"},"length":14,"finishedHeight":36,"additionalFeatures":"","agreement":["By completing this order form and signing this agreement (collectively, the “Agreement”), you are entering into a transaction between you and Metro Railings, a company that specializes in the manufacture and installation of railings and gates (the “Products”) at the specified location below (the “Installation Address”).","##### Term","This Agreement shall begin upon execution and end once the Products are installed at the Installation Address to the specifications listed out on this order form.","##### Customization","The Products will be manufactured and installed according to the design specifications provided and agreed to by you and Metro Railings on this order form.","##### Payment","You agree to pay Metro Railings for its services related to the manufacturing and/or installation of the Products and any other services specified on this order form (the “Order Total”) on this order form.","**A.

Each post will be six inches long so as to allow Deck Remodelers to cut the posts down so that the frame can slide into the privacy wall gracefully. Eight shoes will be provided as well - each shoe will feature a plate that can be screwed directly into the privacy wall. The shoes will serve to hold the frame in place within the privacy wall - after the posts are cut to size, the posts will then slide into these shoes, which will then be attached to the frame. One cover plate will be provided so that Deck Remodelers can cover up the screws that will be used to anchor the bottom post.<br /><br />Each lattice panel will have two pairs of angle brackets, one pair running along the top and one pair lining the bottom. The angle brackets will span the entire length of the panel. These brackets will serve to hold the lattice into place within the frame. Keep in mind that for each pair of angle brackets, one will be welded permanently into place while the other will simply be screwed into place instead.","internal":[{"note":"Lisa authorized payment on this, even though we have yet to deliver the product.

In order to pull this off, installation will need to be divided into stages as Metro Railings and Mourne Construction will need to work jointly in phases to build a wall over the awning. Furthermore, the awning will need to be designed so that the top of the awning going up against the brick exterior will be flat for about 4 to 5\" before descending downward at an angle. The outer wall will be placed over this flat top in such a manner, so that when construction is finished, people can only see the angled part of the awning. <br /><br />A boom lift MAY be needed in order to bring the awnings safely to the rooftop without causing any commotion to the building's residents or risking damage to the interior of the building.","internal":[]},"installation":{"platformType":"concrete","coverPlates":false},"pricing":{"pricePerFoot":760,"additionalPrice":0,"deductions":0,"isTaxApplied":false,"isTariffApplied":false,"subTotal":15200,"tax":0,"tariff":0,"orderTotal":15200,"balanceRemaining":15200,"modification":0,"taxRemaining":0,"restByCheck":false},"customer":{"name":"Mourne Construction NYC","email":"mourneconstruction@hotmail.com","areaCode":"646","phoneOne":"239","phoneTwo":"0494","address":"15 Clark Street","aptSuiteNo":"","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zipCode":"","nickname":"Mourne"},"design":{"post":"N/A","handrailing":"N/A","picket":"","postEnd":"","postCap":"","center":"CD-NONE","color":"Metallic Gray"},"status":"pending","createDate":"2019-05-28T15:23:54.661Z","lastModifiedDate":"2019-07-15T19:20:47.270Z","modHistory":[{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-05-28T15:23:54.661Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-05-28T22:21:58.250Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-05-28T22:33:27.643Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-05-28T22:34:05.449Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-05-28T22:37:10.917Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-07-15T18:54:31.406Z"},{"user":"kinsho","date":"2019-07-15T19:20:47.270Z"}],"stripe":null,"rushOrder":null},{"_id":1932,"notes":{"order":"We offer to fabricate and install interior wrought iron railings for the main stairs to the second floor and also three small sections on the 2nd floor ledge.

The railings will be built according to traditional industrial design principles.<br /><br />The frame of the railings will consist of 1.5\" pipe handrailings and square posts. Two sets of square posts will be employed in order to fabricate all railings - 1.5\" and 2.5\" square posts. Both sets of posts will be used in an alternating fashion, so every odd post will be 1.5\" square while every even post will be a 2.5\" square. The body of the railings will consist of 3/4\" square pickets that are no more than 4\" apart from one another.<br /><br />All railings will be designed in the vista fashion, in that all railings will sport an upper channel devoid of any decorative scrolls or effects. Instead, only the small posts will be allowed to pass through this channel space to join with the pipe handrailing on top. Furthermore, all railings will also come equipped with an intermediate pipe handrail that will protrude from the railing, 36\" off the ground. These intermediate handrails will be finished off with 12\" long loops at each end, in full compliance with ADA code.<br /><br />All railings will be heat-treated and powder coated so as to ensure a lasting finish.<br /><br />Installation will be handled completely by Metro Railings. Any fittings used to join together sections of railings that meet together in any capacity will be somewhat concealed from view. Drainage holes will be drilled into the bottom of each post to ensure that any water that may find its way inside the post can flow out. Each railing post will be anchored into the ground into 6\"-deep cored holes that will then be filled with specialized cement in order to lock the railing into place. The areas where cement will be poured will be masked with cover plates that will themselves be coated with the same finish as the railings. All such railings will be installed level and flush to the ground.","internal":[{"note":"Installed successfully.  We also re-installed the shaky railing.  Everything was washed properly.
